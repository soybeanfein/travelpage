            <h2>Guo Qiao Mi Xian - Crossing the Bridge Rice Noodles</h2>
            <p class="hover-text">Guo Qiao Mi Xian literally translates into crossing the bridge rice noodles, and is an iconic Yunnan dish. The noodles are served in a hot pot, and the sides surround the pot in small dishes (like in the photo). These sides include meat, vegetables, quail eggs, etc. and they are one by one dropped into the pot. I think the aesthetic appeal of the dish, and being able to cook to toppings yourself really preserve the freshness of the food and bring an appreciation into the ingredients. </p>

            <h2>Xi Dou Fen (Porridge)</h2>
            <p class="hover-text">Xidoufen is a dish from Tengchong, my hometown in Yunnan, and a dish that brings me nostalgia and joy. The name directly translates to happy bean powder, as the porridge is made from grinded yellow peas and boiled with water. The thick porridge is eaten with ersi, thin rice noodles, or baba, a Chinese panfried flatbread (like Naan), and like most Yunnan cuisine, seasonings shine in Xidoufen. The porridge is usually seasoned with chilli oil, soy sauce, cilantro, green onions, etc. which makes a flavorful porridge that the noodles can be mixed with or the bread can be dipped into.</p>

            <h2>Er Kuai (Fried Rice Cake)</h2>
            <p class="hover-text">Er Kuai is another dish home to Yunnan. It is made from steamed rice that is pounded into a smooth dough, cut into thick pieces, and boiled. It's chewy, and delicious when fried with sauces and seasonings. I love savoury Er Kuai with meat and green onions!</p>
